* Python <2.7 compat
* Python 3 compat
* Remove the parse\_arg tests (parse\_arg does not exist anymore), fix the json nest\_result option handling, and fix the encode\_sample tests and implementations
* Rework the rest implementation. We now have a single protocol that can manupulate different dataformat thanks to the helpers provided by the xml, json and args modules (which will be used by the adapters too). Some corner cases still don't pass the unittest, and some code cleaning is required
* Add a test for the pecan adapter

* Introduce a new decoratore wsme.protocol.expose, which replaces the clumsy former pexpose
* Reorganise the decorators. expose and validate are now in wsme.rest, and ws.api.signature becomes the raw decorator to declare a function signature. Got rid of the 'pexpose' decorator, which will be replaced later by a better way
* The pecan adapter is now tested
* Make json the default format

* Rest protocols can now take parameters from url + a parameter from the body by adding a parameter body= to expose()
* Add an adapter for pecan
* Add a helper function for adapters that need to convert a function arguments

* Introduce a new decorator: 'sig', which combines expose and validate in a single decorator
* Now use six.with\_metaclass to create the Base type in a python 2/3 compatible way
* spore.getdesc does not take a request anymore but only the host url (it makes the tests simplier)

* Fix the spore 'base\_url' attribute
* Fix the request headers log
* Test SPORE crud function descriptions
* Python 3 compat
* Fix the spore test, as some functions were added by restjson
* Initial implementation of SPORE description of the api (fetch /api.spore to get it)
* Fix test\_default\_usertype
* Test text to bytes auto-conversion
* text and bytes attributes now convert values from/to bytes/text when needed (ascii only conversion)
* Remove the now useless test\_release (the release module was removed)
* Still need to specify the requires int the setup.py, as d2to1 does not seem to handle python\_version dependant metadata
* Now using d2to1, which simplifies a lot the setup.py
* Added tag 0.4b1 for changeset 5ad01afed877

0.4b1
-----

* Update the change log (preparing release 0.4b1
* To avoid any array or dict duplication, use set() instead of list() for the registry array\_types and dict\_types attributes
* Fix ArrayType \_\_eq\_\_ operator so that array types are not duplicated in the registry
* Add more list corner cases to test the soap behavior with empty arrays
* Allow 'None' to be set on an Array attribute
* Mention the new wsme.types.Base type in the changelog
* Fix the demo so that we can use the soap client again, and changed the function names in the client (the soap function naming scheme just changed)
* Fix the array and dict registering. The register() function has to be rethought, as resolve\_type is doing more, and the ArrayType and DictType are in the game
* Mention the wsme.wsgi replacement by wsme.WSRoot.wsgiapp in the changelog
* Python 3 compatibility
* Fix the Enum constructor, and document the change
* Documents the File type
* Rename FileType to File, and make it a complex type instead of a native one

* Fix a problem with protocol specific paths
* Rest protocols now make use of the http method to select the function is needed
* Use request.content\_lenght to check for a request.body existence before accessing it
* Little english mistake fix
* resolve\_type now always returns regular datatypes, never weak refs. Generally speaking weakrefs should remain inside the registry
* Registry.lookup does not return weakrefs anymore. resolve\_type does it instead
* Python 3 compatibility
* Adapt tests and fix remaining issues with the list/dict handling changes
* Fix various bugs revealed by the soap unit tests
* Improve dict and array types handling by introducing DictType and ArrayType. Nested structures should have a better behavior
* Fix the list of complex types handling (dicts are not ok yet, and lists still not complet imo)
* Test attributes which are lists of complex types
* Got lost in metaclass \_\_new\_\_/\_\_init\_\_ choice. Yet another attempt using both (needed by wsme-sqlalchemy)
* My last commit was a mistake : it is better to use \_\_new\_\_, so that the class registering is done the later
* Use the metaclass \_\_init\_\_ instead of \_\_new\_\_ so that the class inspection occurs later, making it possible to add attributes in a sub-metaclass \_\_new\_\_ of \_\_init\_\_
* Use py2 & py3 compatible metaclass
* Attempting a on-demand resolution of datatypes references, so we don't need to call resolve\_references anymore. It works with python 2, but not yet python 3 (some weakref issues)
* Add a type Registry. It mainly allow to have easy cross-referenced types by setting the attribute datatype to the class name instead of the class instance. It may allow to have separate registry for different apis in the future

* Completing the Changelog
* Add a test for unset attributes

* TG1 server.webpath mechanics makes it impossible to use a filter on the controller itself. So we put it on the root controller and carrefully change the WSRoot webpath so that everything works properly
* BugFix: if no Content-Type header is present, read\_arguments would fail
* Completing the changelog
* Better handling of errors on protocol selection
* Don't stop if the body is application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded and the request has params (for other encoding it would mean both params and a body were provided)

* Added tag 0.1.0 for changeset b0019e486c80

0.1.0
-----

* Going 0.1.0 now that at least 1 application is runnging wsme. We are still in alpha state though
* Protocols are now stored in a list so that the order is considered when selecting the right protocol for a request
* expose now takes extra options that can be used by the protocols
* getprotocol now takes the options as named arguments, which make it easier to use from outside
* Remove the soap protocol (I am moving it to wsme-soap

-------

* Update the doc and the version number

* Add the todo page to the index
* Completing the changes list for 0.1.0a3
* Add a little 'Install' section

* Adapt the rest xml tests
* Adapted the restjson tests to the changes I made for the soap tests
* The soap test case now fully pass. We are getting closer to a working implementation, but I think I messed up the namespaces
* Start implementing a 'fromsoap' set of functions
* A few more fixes on tests and return values in soap before diving into arguments feeding
* Missing arguments are now detected by the controller
* Fix a few tests
* A few utility functions
* Most of the return types now works with soap
* Making progress on the soap implementation. Will have to choose between Genshi and ElementTree though, it is getting anoying to juggle with both
* Adapt the rest protocol implementation to the changes I did for the soap protocol
* Working on the soap protocol
* Fix a few dummy errors

* rest+xml now handle the basic return types
* Add unittests for rest+xml
* Continue working on the rest-xml tests and implementation +  changed the RestProtocol interface

* Structured types basically work with rest+json
* Rename AttrDef to wsattr, and introduce wsproperty
* Implementing the structured types inspection
* Start working on the non-trivial types handling
* rename WSRoot.debug to WSRoot.\_debug to avoid an infinite recursion when scanning the api (which will need a better implementation anyway)

* the rest+json protocol starts to work with basic return types
* Lowercased the project name
* Start implementing the rest json proto
* Completed the register test so we have 100% of test coverage
* Renamed EWS to WSME because ews is already taken on pypi
* A first working implemetation for the core controller code
